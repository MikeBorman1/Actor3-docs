#### 6. Next go to the Instalments tab, here we can auto generate instalments based on the Account Freq or we can add them manually

- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Half Yearly
- Yearly

Select the option that applies best to the risk and hit generate. You may need to change the dates on the generated instalments to match with the risk.

#### 7. If everything has been done correctly you should see a series of "Ok" as shown below. If not and your figures dont match up, check that your instalments add up to the risk code premium entered.
